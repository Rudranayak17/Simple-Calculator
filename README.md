# Simple Calculator

A basic calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator allows users to perform arithmetic calculations, view the equation being built, and get the result.

## Features

- Numeric buttons (0-9) for input.
- Decimal point button for floating-point numbers.
- Operator buttons (+, -, *, /) for basic arithmetic operations.
- Equals (=) button to evaluate the equation and display the result.
- Clear (C) button to clear the current input.
- Real-time equation display to visualize the ongoing calculation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Use the numeric buttons and operators to build the equation.

4. Click the "=" button to see the result of the equation.

5. To clear the input, click the "C" button.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the calculator interface.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the calculator.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for calculator functionality.

## Note

- This calculator uses the `eval()` function to evaluate equations. While it works for basic calculations, it's important to note that using `eval()` can have security implications if used improperly. In a real-world scenario, consider implementing a safer way to evaluate expressions.
